# Head First Design Patterns

Programming along with [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Freeman/dp/0596007124) (HFDP).

## Java version

Because the edition of Head First Design Patterns I'm using was published in 2004, I'm using Java 8 to match the syntax of the book. I do this using [JEnv](https://www.jenv.be) with OpenJDK 1.8.0.
